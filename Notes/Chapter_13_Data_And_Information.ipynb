    "# 13.0 Representation of Positive Integers\n",
    "\n",
    "All of us are familiar with the use of positive integers. In particular, we grew up learning how to count from a young age and (hopefully) none of us consider counting from 1 to 100 to be difficult. To count, we need to first understand the meanings of the symbols 0, 1, 2, . . ., 9 and also, the meaning of positions two identical in the integer. This way of writing out numbers is termed **positional notation / number system**. For example, when we write the number `107` to represent **one hundred and  seven**, we actually mean $$1\\times 10^2 +0\\times 10^1 +7\\times 10^0.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, note that in our modern use of Hindu-Arabic numbers, we have 10 different symbols that we could mix and match to generate more numbers with by switching their positions in our writing. The number of such different symbols in a number system is called the **base** or **radix** of the number system. Thus, with this definition, our usual number system is base-10. This number system is also called **decimal** number system or **denary** system.\n",

    "However, from the diagram of symbols above, we see that they actually have more than 10 symbols in their system. In fact, Babylonian number system is more akin to our modern base-60 system.

    "Values are stored inside a computer as a series of 0s and 1s. A single 0 or 1 is called a **binary digit** or **bit**. Any group of 0s and 1s can be used to represent a specific character, for example, a letter. The number of bits used to store one character is called a **byte**. The complete set of characters that the computer uses is known as its **character set**. For example, the character `A` could be stored as `00000001`. The representation of characters as in terms of `0`s and `1`s are called **binary representation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary representation is a suitable representation of values in a computer as the circuits in a computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors, tiny switches that are activated by the electronic signals it receives and building blocks of modern computers. The digits 1 and 0 used in binary reflect the on and off states of a transistor.\n",

    "A good way of thinking about the character set for a normal computer is to have a look at the characters that are available on its keyboard. For this character set, eight bits are used to store a single character. Using a byte (eight bits) for a character, we can store up to 256 unique characters (i.e. 256 different eight-bit binary values). This is enough to represent each of the characters on a standard keyboard (Most Windows based keyboard has 104 keys).\n",

This caused documents created on one of the computers to be unreadable on another.\n",

As more services become available online, the risk of fraudent use of data increases. For instance, with a photo of your identity card, a person can impersonate you and register for a new phone line on a telco website.

However, a shopping mall cannot collect the photographs of NRICs of all the shoppers that want to participate in their lucky draw. It is unnecessary to collect the photographs to verify the lucky draw participant.
